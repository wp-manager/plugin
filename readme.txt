A companion plugin to provide further REST API routes for WP Manager

== Description ==
**Disclaimer**
*WP Manager is in beta and under active development. This plugin will be updated regularly to add new features and fix bugs.*

This plugin is primarily made for use with WP Manager, a centralised application to manage WordPress sites at scale.

The role of this plugin is to provide more detailed information about a WordPress site via additional REST endpoints that the native WordPress REST API doesn't offer.

== Installation ==
- Install and activate this plugin
- Create an account on [WP Manager](https://wp-manager.io?utm_source=plugin&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=general) and add your site
- That's it! You should be able to see more detailed information about your WordPress install via WP Manager
